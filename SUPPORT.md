## Status

Webinizer is a WPE pathfinding project and as such is not yet suitable for broad usage. Support
bandwidth is limited, and we will focus on well documented [issues], ideally with test cases. We
always welcome contributions, for more detail see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). Caveat Emptor.
