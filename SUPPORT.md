## Status

Webinizer is a BETA project and is not yet fully production ready, although we encourage usage and
experimentation. Support bandwidth is limited, and we will focus on well documented [issues],
ideally with test cases. We always welcome contributions, for more detail see
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). Caveat Emptor.
